This hack contains a frontend webapp built on Next.js and a backend build on Flask (python). It utilizies the Twilio API. The purpose of this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface that people can use to set up reminders to take their various medications. It is highly customizable, and users can create reminders with the medicationâ€™s name, description, dosage, and frequency for intake. Once a reminder is created, users will receive regular text messages in the set intervals they specified.

## Hosting

To get started: clone this repository and run `npm i` in the terminal to install the required node modules. Run `npm run dev` to start the developmental server.

In another terminal, run `venv/Scripts/activate` to activate the virtual environment. Then, run `flask run` to start the flask server.

Now in your favorite web browser, go to ```http://localhost:3000``` to access the webapp and create your first reminder! Make sure to change the phone number in the `src/components/home/Reminder.jsx`. (You need to go to Twilio and verify this phone number in order to get text messages set to it!)
